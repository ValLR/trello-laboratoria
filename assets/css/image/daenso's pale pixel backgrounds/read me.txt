You can use these backgrounds, there's no need to credit me, but please don't repost or distribute as yours.

You can change their colour with photoshop. For example, if you need a background with a pink shade and white dots
while mine is with with grey dots, you can open the .png file with photoshop then go to image > adjustements > gradient map,
choose your colours (in this case pink and white) and apply. You can even change its exposure if it''s too light.

Enjoy!
